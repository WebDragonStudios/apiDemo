# apiDemo
Short Demo to show an API call

This is a short demo on making an API call. Normally it would be pulling data from a database, but for this demonstration it'll be pulling from a list inside the TeamController. You are able to select a team buy its ID number on the left, or you can follow the URL structure "/api/team/{team number here}". For example, /api/team/2 will bring up the information on the New York Mets.

Normally I wouldn't do an onClick event (or the jQuery function in the index page), but since this was more to show API usage I stuck it in there.
